# Advanced Clean Architecture in SwiftUI: Enhancing Generics, Dependency Injection, and TDD

As SwiftUI applications become more complex, adopting a clean and scalable architecture is crucial for maintainability. Clean Architecture provides a solid foundation for organizing code, but we can take it further by leveraging advanced generics, protocols, and modern dependency injection techniques.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- **Design Highly Generic Use Cases and Repositories**: Minimize code duplication by using powerful generics to create reusable components.
- **Implement a Centralized Dependency Injection Container**: Simplify dependency management by injecting services and objects into your views in a seamless and controlled way.
- **Create a Reusable View Container**: Separate data fetching logic from UI rendering to decouple concerns and improve reusability.
- **Utilize Swift’s Concurrency Features**: Leverage the async/await pattern to write modern, efficient asynchronous code.

### Example: API Endpoint Protocol

The following protocol defines an API endpoint, abstracting the details of a network request:

```swift
/// A protocol representing an API endpoint.
protocol Endpoint {
    /// The URL request associated with the endpoint.
    var urlRequest: URLRequest { get }
}
